# Internal http server to deliver the pack

# By default, the internal server will not be used and your pack will be provided by the Cosmo servers.
# By doing so, if the pack is updated whilst the server is live, it will cause the next players to login to receive
# a more up to date pack and previously logged in players must re-log. Using the internal server is ideal as it will
# prevent the de-sync.
